                            <p class="daniel-rev2">"I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp, I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for free intro course and found it incredible fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best- and most gruenling-time of my life. Since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup."</p>

                <h1>Such a life-changing experience. Highly recimmended!</h1>

                <p>"Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a  former student of theirs who can only say wounderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were hands-on and I never had to wait long for assisance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've oftenn referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer afeter receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!"</p>

                <p>"The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest.
